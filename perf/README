Simple swarm/thevoid performance testing tool
Client creates @chunk number of requests, starts event loop,
waits until all requests have been finished and stops the loop.

This is repeated multiple times (until total number of requests reaches @requests)
Number of requests per second is being written during the test.

Usage example:
$ swarm_perf_server -c server-config.json

$ swarm_perf_client --url http://localhost:8080/get
...
num: 1000, performance: 9009
num: 1000, performance: 9009
num: 1000, performance: 8928
num: 100000, performance: 8374
$
